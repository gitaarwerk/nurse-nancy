# Nurse Nancy
NurseNancy is a World of Warcraft addon that provides an notification when you are casting a resurrection spell. It's especially useful for healers who want to know when to expect to have their resurrect spell interrupted or to coordinate with other healers. This in a random and funny way.

## Installation
- Download the latest version of the NurseNancy addon from (https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nurse-nancy)[the CurseForge page].
- Extract the downloaded archive and copy the NurseNancy folder to your WoW Interface/AddOns directory.
- Launch WoW and log in to your character.
- Open the AddOns tab in the character selection screen and make sure NurseNancy is enabled.

## Usage
NurseNancy automatically monitors any resurrection spells cast by you in your group or raid. 

To access the settings, type `/nn` or `/nursenancy` in the chat window or use the Blizzard addon settings interface (Esc -> Interface -> AddOns -> NurseNancy).

In the settings, you can also configure which spells to monitor and enable/disable chat notifications of resurrection spells.
